The unmanned aerial vehicle formation plays a crucial role in numerous
applications, such as reconnaissance, agricultural plant protection, and electric
power inspection. This paper provides a comprehensive review and analysis of
the unmanned aerial vehicle swarm communication networks and formation
control strategies. First, the most commonly used unmanned aerial vehicles are
introduced and compared. Next, the entire process of the formation task, from
the formation assignment to the formation transformation, is detailed described.
At last, the widely adopted communication networks are analyzed, and the
existing formation control strategies of the UAV swarm are compared, which
shows that the distributed formation control is superior to the centralized
method and is the future development trend.

Swarm of robots is a group of multiple autonomous agents, collaborating with each other to achieve collective missions such as surveillance and tracking. In Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) swarms, robust and 
 ecentralized communication between the agents is required. To this end, Software-In-The-Loop (SIL) is performed before the actual ï¬‚ight to avoid the risk of failure. However, single-platform-based simulations can 
 either fully encounter nor resolve the communication challenges. In this work, we target to incorporate the real-time communication challenges such as network failure, faced by multi-agent systems via Hardware-In-The-Loop (HIL) simulation using Robot-Operating-System (ROS), Gazebo and off the shelf communication modems. A Ground-Control-Station (GCS) is developed to monitor and supervise autonomous UAVs missions. The multiplatform HIL completely emulates the multi-agent system and the communication between the agents, thereby reducing the risk of swarm failure.

[Video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uB29Q0hU6Z8) : Robust Communication for Autonomous Drone Swarms / MQLINK_A_Scalable_and_Robust_Communication_Network_for_Autonomous_Drone_Swarms
This research task presents a novel drone network architecture, named MQLINK, for autonomous drone swarms which simultaneously addresses the issues of communication, coordination, and scalability. The proposed system utilizes a lightweight, efficient MQTT protocol and incorporates a self developed UAVLINK module to ensure robust communication in various scenarios such as emergencies and infrastructure failures. The effectiveness of MQLINK in leader-follower formation and proximity detection is demonstrated through real-world experiments for the prototypes. This work advances drone swarm technology, offering a practical solution for enhancing mission efficiency, completion rate and group complementarity. The wide spread applications include drone display, surveillance, logistics, construction site inspection, disaster relief and more.
