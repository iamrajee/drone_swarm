# Implementation Of a Visual Communication Protocol For Drone Swarm Members

This algorithm was created for my final project of college.

I used Python 3.0 and Coppelia Robots library for the simulation.

There are two scenes on this project:
  - Scene one is just to show the messages that the drones can do.
  - The second one is a simulation of what could happen in the real world.
