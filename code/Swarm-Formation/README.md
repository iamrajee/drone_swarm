# Swarm-Formation

**Swarm-Formation** is a distributed swarm trajectory optimization framework for formation flight in dense environments.
- A differentiable graph-theory-based cost function that effectively describes the interaction topology of robots and quantifies the similarity distance between three-dimensional formations.
- A spatial-temporal optimization framework with a joint cost function that takes formation similarity, obstacle avoidance, and dynamic feasibility into account, which makes the swarm robots possess the ability to move in formation while avoiding obstacles.

## News
- **October 9, 2022** - An improved version which achieves fully autonomous large-scale formation flight in dense environments with a complete formation navigation system has been submitted to IEEE Transactions on Robotics [Preprint](https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.04048), [Bilibili](https://www.bilibili.com/video/BV1wB4y177io/?spm_id_from=333.999.0.0).
- **April 20, 2022** - A robust version [v1.1](https://github.com/ZJU-FAST-Lab/Swarm-Formation/releases/tag/v1.1) has been open-sourced for [ICRA2022](https://arxiv.org/abs/2109.07682).

## 2. Quick Start within 3 Minutes
Compiling tests passed on ubuntu 18.04 and 20.04 with ros installed. You can just execute the following commands one by one.
```
sudo apt-get install libarmadillo-dev
git clone https://github.com/ZJU-FAST-Lab/Swarm-Formation.git
cd Swarm-Formation
catkin_make -j1
source devel/setup.bash
roslaunch ego_planner rviz.launch
```
Then open a new command window in the same workspace and execute the following commands one by one.
```
source devel/setup.bash
roslaunch ego_planner normal_hexagon.launch
```
Then use **"2D Nav Goal"** in rviz to publish the goal for swarm formation navigation. You need to specify the value of **flight_type** in run_in_sim.launch:
<p align = "center">
<img src="fig/set_goal_normal_hexagon.gif" width = "800" height = "363" border="2" />
</p>

**Now only two forms are supported to specify the target point.**
- flight_type = 2: use global waypoints
- flight_type = 3: use "2D Nav Goal" to select goal  

Finally, you can see a normal hexagon formation navigating in random forest map.

## 3. Tips
1. We recommend developers to use **[rosmon](http://wiki.ros.org/rosmon)** to replace the **roslaunch**
- **Why we use rosmon?** : 
  It is very developer-friendly, especially for the development of multi-robots. 
- **How to use rosmon?** :
  [Install](http://wiki.ros.org/rosmon):
  ```
  sudo apt install ros-${ROS_DISTRO}-rosmon
  source /opt/ros/${ROS_DISTRO}/setup.bash # Needed to use the 'mon launch' shortcut
  ```
  Run the simple example of our project:
  ```
  source devel/setup.bash
  roslaunch ego_planner rviz.launch
  ```
  Then open a new command window in the same workspace and use **rosmon**:
  ```
  source devel/setup.bash
  mon launch ego_planner normal_hexagon.launch
  ```
  <p align = "center">
  <img src="fig/rosmon.jpg" width = "566" height = "379" border="2" />
  </p>

## 4. Important updates
- **May 9, 2022** -Add Interface: Publish target points through "2D Nav Goal" in rviz for swarm formation navigation.
- **April 12, 2022** - A distributed swarm formation optizamition framework is released. An example of normal hexagon formation navigation in random forest map is given.
